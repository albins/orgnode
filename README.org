* Orgnode
[[http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/orgnode.html][»Orgnode - reading org-mode in Python«]] was originally developed by
[[http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/][Charles Cave]]. This is a fork by Takafumi Arakaki, with some minor
fixes by Albin Stjerna.
* How to use
Just set the =Orgnode.py= where your python can import this module.

Some samples (directly from Cave's version):
#+begin_src python
import Orgnode, datetime

today = datetime.date.today()
print "Daily plan for", today
print "-------------------------\n"

filename = "c:/charles/GTD/newgtd.org"
nodelist = Orgnode.makelist(filename)

for n in nodelist:
    if n.Scheduled() == today:
         print "[ ] %s (%s)" % (n.Heading(), n.Tag() )
#+end_src

* Differences to Araraki's and Cave's versions
So far, the only thing I've really done is adding a few test cases and
fixing a bug in one of the regular expressions that would produce
incorrect results when a TODO keyword appeared inside a paragraph. I
do, however, intend to use orgnode, and improve on it when I find
bugs.

As far as I can tell, Araraki's verison is a significant improvement
over Cave's, fixing proper unicode handling among other things.
