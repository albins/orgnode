README for Orgnode
==================

Orgnode
=======

"`Orgnode - reading org-mode in Python`_" is originally developed by
`Charles Cave`_. This is a fork by Takafumi Arakaki, with some minor
fixes by Albin Stjerna.

How to use
==========

Just set the Orgnode.py where your python can import this module.

Differences to Araraki's and Cave's versions
============================================

So far, the only thing I've really done is added a few test cases and
fixing a bug in one of the regular expressions that would produce
incorrect results when a TODO keyword appeared inside a paragraph. I
do, however, intend to use orgnode, and improve on it when I find
bugs.

As far as I can tell, Araraki's verison is a significant improvement
over Cave's, fixing proper unicode handling among other things.
